    <h2 id="tribute-info">Synopsis of the show Danny Phantom:</h2>
  <p> Danny Phantom was an animated series that first aried April 3, 2004.It was created by Butch Hartmen and aired on Nickelodeon.The first episode aired following the 2004 Kid's Choice Awards. The show would go on airing for 3 years with a total of 57 episodes and spanning 3 seasons.Danny Phantom has spawned video games, home video releases, as well as toys and various other merchandise.</p>
    <p>Danny Phantom centers on the life and adventures of 14-year-old Danny Fenton, a shy and quiet high school student living in the small town of Amity Park. He lives with his eccentric ghost-hunting parents, Maddie and Jack, and his overprotective but caring 16-year-old sister, Jazz. Upon pressure from one of his best friends, goth girl Samantha "Sam" Manson, Danny decides to explore the Ghost Portal that his parents had created in a failed attempt to bridge the real world and the Ghost Zone (the parallel universe in which ghosts reside). Once inside, he inadvertently presses the "On" button (which his parents failed to do), thus activating the Portal, infusing his DNA with ectoplasm, and transforming him into a half-ghost.</p>
    <p>Danny, who calls himself "Danny Phantom" in ghost form, develops the ability to fly, to become invisible, to become intangible, and to "overshadow" (possess and control) people after first learning how to switch back and forth at will between his ghost and human forms. Over time, he develops much stronger abilities, such as his Ghost Ray (a concentrated blast of kinetic energy he fires from his hand), his Ghostly Wail (an intensely powerful scream with sonic capabilities that knocks back anything caught in its path), telekinesis and even cryokinesis. Danny is initially frightened by his new abilities and has little control over them, but he soon learns to use them to protect his town from malevolent ghosts. Danny turns to the life of a superhero, using his powers to rid his hometown from the various ghosts who plague it and are almost always brought into the world thanks to the sporadic activation of the Fentons' Ghost Portal. Sam, fun-loving technophile Tucker Foley, and eventually Jazz are Danny's primary allies in his ghost-fighting activities.</p>
